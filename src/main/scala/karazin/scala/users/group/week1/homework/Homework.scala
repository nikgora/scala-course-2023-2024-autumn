/**
 * Preface
 * Implement all the things with ???.
 * All implementations must be tail-recursive is possible.
 * Feel free to use internal methods/functions.
 * Feel free to adjust signatures of hacked methods/functions.
 *
 * 1. Boolean Operators
 * Required task
 * Implement eager boolean operations Not, And and Or.
 * Requirements:
 * a) the function should not use embedded boolean operations
 * b) the functions should be eager
 * c) the function should use `if` expression and `true` and `false` boolean literals 
 *
 * 2. Fermat Numbers
 * Required task
 * Implement function which should calculate n-th Fermat number:
 * Fn = 2 ^ (2 ^ n) + 1, n is non-negative
 * Requirements:
 * a) the function should not use multiplication and power operations
 * b) the functions should only use addition operation
 * For more details @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_number
 *
 * 3. Look-and-say Sequence
 * Required task
 * Implement function which should calculate n-th number of Look-and-say sequence
 * For more details @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence
 *
 * 4. Kolakoski sequence
 * Optional super challenging task
 * Implement function which should calculate n-th number of Kolakoski sequence
 * For more details @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolakoski_sequence
